# ðŸ§  CT Reconstruction using Filtered Back Projection (FBP)

This project demonstrates how to simulate Computed Tomography (CT) image reconstruction using the **Filtered Back Projection (FBP)** algorithm in Python. It uses a synthetic medical image known as the **Shepp-Logan Phantom**, a standard test pattern in tomography, and reconstructs the original image from its projections using the **Radon transform** and **Inverse Radon transform**.

## Background

**Computed Tomography (CT)** is a medical imaging technique where a series of X-ray images are taken from different angles around a subject. These are then used to reconstruct cross-sectional views (slices) of the internal structure.

### Radon Transform
The **Radon transform** computes the projection of an image along specified angles, simulating how X-rays pass through tissue in a CT scan. The collection of projections from multiple angles forms a **sinogram**.

### Filtered Back Projection (FBP)
FBP is a classical method used to reconstruct images from their sinograms. It involves two steps:
1. **Filtering** the sinogram to correct for distortion.
2. **Back-projecting** each filtered projection across the image domain to form the final image.

## Algorithm Overview

1. **Generate Phantom**: Create a 2D Shepp-Logan Phantom image.
2. **Preprocessing**: Pad or resize the phantom to a square size suitable for Radon transform.
3. **Projection**: Use the Radon transform to simulate projection data at multiple angles.
4. **Reconstruction**: Apply the inverse Radon transform using the FBP method.
5. **Visualization**: Display the original image, the sinogram, and the reconstructed result.

## Dependencies

Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-image scipy
```


## Example Output

The code will display the following:


### Original Phantom
A synthetic CT slice used as the input image.

---

### Sinogram (Radon Transform)
The simulated X-ray projections collected at angles from 0 to 180 degrees.

### Reconstructed Image
An approximation of the original image using the filtered back projection algorithm.

You should see a 3-panel figure showing:
- The original phantom
- The sinogram
- The FBP reconstruction
